# Todo

In this project i wanted to demonstrate my abilities to use the principles of OOP by using classes. <br>
The code was written in the 'clean code' metodology of 'uncle bob'.
<br>
I designed by myself a TO-DO list that allows you to set list of tasks with Expiry Date. you can mark tasks as "finished", view only active tasks or view all tasks.
